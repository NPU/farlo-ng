# THIS IS NOT THE OFICIAL RELEASE YET

# NOTICE: THIS TOOL HAS BEEN WRITTEN FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!

## History

This version is *based* on an old project that I did some time ago (may be 2009/2010...)

## Farlo-NG

Tool to crack WEP/WPA/WPA2 wireless networks in realtime

## How does it works?

This tool works by generating and testing all possible default passwords for each wireless AP based on ESSID and BSSID.
Also you can specify a custom password dictionary to try to crack the network when the default password has been changed.

## Default passwords?

Yes, the information has been taken from tools like wlandecrypter, jazzteldecrypter, decsagem, wlan4x....

If I have not mentioned you under "Credits", let me know to fix it.

## WPA/WPA2

Not so good... Actually, network cracking (password verifying :P) only works with WEP encrypted networks, BUT when a WPA/WPA2 network is found, this tool will save all the generated passwords into a single file in the same path.

## What's the purpose of 'patterns.xml' file?

This file specifies wich algorithm must be applied to each network (may be many algorithms for the same network pattern).

Thanks to Seguridad Wireless guys and many others for disclousure their wireless security researches
