{"body":"# THIS IS NOT THE OFICIAL RELEASE YET\r\n\r\n# NOTICE: THIS TOOL HAS BEEN WRITTEN FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\nThis version is based on an old project that I did some time ago (may be 2009/2010...)\r\n\r\n## Farlo-NG\r\n\r\nTool to crack WEP/WPA/WPA2 wireless networks in realtime\r\n\r\n## How does it works?\r\n\r\nThis tool works by generating and testing all possible default passwords for each wireless AP based on ESSID and BSSID.\r\nAlso you can specify a custom password dictionary to try to crack the network when the default password has been changed.\r\n\r\n## Default passwords?\r\n\r\nYes, the information has been taken from tools like wlandecrypter, jazzteldecrypter, decsagem, wlan4x....\r\n\r\nIf I have not mentioned you under \"Credits\", let me know to fix it.\r\n\r\n## WPA/WPA2\r\n\r\nNot so good... Actually, network cracking (password verifying :P) only works with WEP encrypted networks, BUT when a WPA/WPA2 network is found, this tool will save all the generated passwords into a single file in the same path.\r\n\r\n## What's the purpose of 'patterns.xml' file?\r\n\r\nThis file specifies wich algorithm must be applied to each network (may be many algorithms for the same network pattern).\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThanks to Seguridad Wireless guys and many others for disclousure their wireless security researches\r\n","name":"Farlo-NG","google":"UA-33867972-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
